 * \brief Play beeps and music with the buzzer.
 *
 * The PololuBuzzer library allows various sounds to be played through a buzzer,
 * from simple beeps to complex tunes.
 *
 * On the ATmega328P/168 boards, this library uses Timer 2 and pin 3 (PD3/OC2B).
 * On ATmega32U4 boards, this library uses Timer 4 and pin 6 (PD7/OC4D).  This
 * library will conflict will other libraries that use the same timer or pin.
 *
 * Note durations are timed using a timer overflow interrupt
 * (`TIMER2_OVF`/`TIMER4_OVF`), which will briefly interrupt execution of your
 * main program at the frequency of the sound being played. In most cases, the
 * interrupt-handling routine is very short (several microseconds). However,
 * when playing a sequence of notes in `PLAY_AUTOMATIC` mode (the default mode)
 * with the `play()` command, this interrupt takes much longer than normal
 * (perhaps several hundred microseconds) every time it starts a new note. It is
 * important to take this into account when writing timing-critical code.
 *
 * This library is fully compatible with the OrangutanBuzzer functions
 * in the [Pololu AVR C/C++ Library](http://www.pololu.com/docs/0J18)
 * and the [ZumoBuzzer library](https://github.com/pololu/zumo-shield),
 * so any sequences and melodies written for those libraries will also work
 * with the equivalent PololuBuzzer functions. */

  /*! \brief Plays the specified frequency for the specified duration.
   *
   * \param freq     Frequency to play in Hz (or 0.1 Hz if the `DIV_BY_10` bit
   *                 is set).
   * \param duration Duration of the note in milliseconds.
   * \param volume   Volume of the note (0--15).
   *
   * The \a frequency argument must be between 40 Hz and 10 kHz. If the most
   * significant bit of \a frequency is set, the frequency played is the value
   * of the lower 15 bits of \a frequency in units of 0.1 Hz. Therefore, you can
   * play a frequency of 44.5 Hz by using a \a frequency of `(DIV_BY_10 | 445)`.
   * If the most significant bit of \a frequency is not set, the units for
   * frequency are Hz. The \a volume argument controls the buzzer volume, with
   * 15 being the loudest and 0 being the quietest. A \a volume of 15 supplies
   * the buzzer with a 50% duty cycle PWM at the specified \a frequency.
   * Lowering \a volume by one halves the duty cycle (so 14 gives a 25% duty
   * cycle, 13 gives a 12.5% duty cycle, etc). The volume control is somewhat
   * crude (especially on the ATmega328/168) and should be thought of as a bonus
   * feature.
   *
   * This function plays the note in the background while your program continues
   * to execute. If you call another buzzer function while the note is playing,
   * the new function call will overwrite the previous and take control of the
   * buzzer. If you want to string notes together, you should either use the
   * `play()` function or put an appropriate delay after you start a note
   * playing. You can use the `is_playing()` function to figure out when the
   * buzzer is through playing its note or melody.
   *
   * ### Example ###
   *
   * ~~~{.cpp}
   * PololuBuzzer buzzer;
   *
   * ...
   *
   * // play a 6 kHz note for 250 ms at a lower volume
   * buzzer.playFrequency(6000, 250, 12);
   *
   * // wait for buzzer to finish playing the note
   * while (buzzer.isPlaying());
   *
   * // play a 44.5 Hz note for 1 s at full volume
   * buzzer.playFrequency(DIV_BY_10 | 445, 1000, 15);
   * ~~~
   *
   * \warning \a frequency &times; \a duration / 1000 must be no greater than
   * 0xFFFF (65535). This means you can't use a duration of 65535 ms for
   * frequencies greater than 1 kHz. For example, the maximum duration you can
   * use for a frequency of 10 kHz is 6553 ms. If you use a duration longer than
   * this, you will produce an integer overflow that can result in unexpected
   * behavior.

   *  \param sequence Char array containing a sequence of notes to play.
   *
   * If the play mode is `PLAY_AUTOMATIC` (default), the sequence of notes will
   * play with no further action required by the user. If the play mode is
   * `PLAY_CHECK`, the user will need to call `playCheck()` in the main loop to
   * initiate the playing of each new note in the sequence. The play mode can be
   * changed while the sequence is playing. The sequence syntax is modeled after
   * the PLAY commands in GW-BASIC, with just a few differences.
   *
   * The notes are specified by the characters **C**, **D**, **E**, **F**,
   * **G**, **A**, and **B**, and they are played by default as "quarter notes"
   * with a length of 500 ms. This corresponds to a tempo of 120 beats/min.
   * Other durations can be specified by putting a number immediately after the
   * note. For example, C8 specifies C played as an eighth note, with half the
   * duration of a quarter note. The special note **R** plays a rest (no sound).
   * The sequence parser is case-insensitive and ignores spaces, which may be
   * used to format your music nicely.
   *
   * Various control characters alter the sound:
   * <table>
   * <tr><th>Control character(s)</th><th>Effect</th></tr>
   * <tr><td><strong>A--G</strong></td>
   *     <td>Specifies a note that will be played.</td></tr>

   * <tr><td><strong>.</strong> after a note</td>
   *     <td>"Dots" the preceding note, increasing the length by 50%. Each
   *         additional dot adds half as much as the previous dot, so that "A.."
   *         is 1.75 times the length of "A".</td></tr>
